My first complete project utilizing both Backend(node.js and Express), frontend(html, css and javascript) as well as Google's Gemini API with FastAPI.

The project is an AI-powered tool that provides automated code reviews, helping developers improve code quality and efficiency. 

üìå Features 

User Authentication: Secure login and signup with JWT-based authentication.  
Live AI Code Review: Real-time AI feedback using WebSockets.  
Recent Reviews Storage: Keeps track of the last five reviews for reference. (This is unfortunately currently bugged and I will be putting out a fix in thenearest future). 
Dark Mode Toggle: User-friendly UI with a sleek dark mode option.  
Profile Management: Users can update their name, email, and profile picture.  
Secure API: Uses rate limiting and session expiry handling.
